# CPPTransient-Response-Analysis
The program finds the solution of 1st order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) using well known methods; namely, Euler’s and Runge-Kutta 4th Order Methods

For the thin, glass-walled mercury thermometer system shown in Figure 1, assume that
the temperature of the bath changes based on certain chemical process occurring between two
substances reacting with each other inside the bath. It is found that the equation that describes this
process is given as follows:
𝑑𝜃(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 + 2𝜃(𝑡) = cos 4𝑡

It can be found that the actual solution of the response of the thermometer, 𝜃(𝑡), is given by the
following equation:
𝜃(𝑡) = 0.1 cos 4𝑡 + 0.2 sin 4𝑡 + 2.9e^-2t
